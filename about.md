Our lives are increasing bound into a digital realm and it can be great to be connected and, you know, have something to do even when your stuck waiting for things to happen. But a few of us are starting to consider that maybe we've lost something along the way; the space between. 

This project explores spaces between, between digital and analogue, between us and technology and between the machine and the natural and a few other between other spaces we want you to discover yourself. 

Please join us on this journey in exploring the space between the one and the zero.
